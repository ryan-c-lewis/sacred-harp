# What is Sacred Harp?
Sacred Harp is an American religious folk music tradition that began in the 18th century. There are no harps or other instruments; the "sacred harp" is the human voice.

# What is this repo?
I have no formal training in music theory but I'd like to try my hand at composing this style of music, so I want to learn more about how it's "built." I'd like to be able to answer questions like, "What chord progressions are most common in major-keyed songs?" "What is a comfortable range for the bass line?" etc.
