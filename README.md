# What is Sacred Harp?
Sacred Harp is an American religious folk music tradition that began in the 18th century. There are no harps or other instruments; the "sacred harp" is the human voice.

# What is this repo?
I've got two main goals here:
* I have no formal training in music theory but I'd like to try my hand at composing this style of music, so I want to learn more about how it's "built." I'd like to be able to answer questions like, "What chord progressions are most common in major-keyed songs?" "What is a comfortable range for the bass line?" etc.
* I want to explore machine learning for music, and I think Sacred Harp is prime for that. Compared to classical piano or modern pop, Sacred Harp is very rigid and formulaic. There are fewer variables to be considered than in other types of music.

So, this project is intended for research and not to create a product that can be consumed. If eventually I end up with something that might be useful to others, I'll split that out into its own library. But for now that's not on the radar.
